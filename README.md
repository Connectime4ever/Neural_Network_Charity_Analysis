# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
#### The purpose of this project is to help a Fundation predict where to make investments by using TensorFlow and a neural network or deep learning model to create a binary classifier. 
#### This binary classification model will be used to predict whether the organizations that might receive funds from the foundation will be successful based on the features in the dataset.  
#### In this sense, the first step is to preprocess the dataset using Pandas and Scikit-Learn's StandarScaler().
#### Finally, the binary classification model created should be optimized using TensorFlow to meet a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%. It is required that at least three attempts are made to meet this target.


## Results
 Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

***Data Preprocessing***
+ What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
+ What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
+ What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

***Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model***
+ How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
+ Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
+ What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary

 + Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. 
 
 + Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, 
 
 + and explain your recommendation.
